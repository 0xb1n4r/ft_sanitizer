# Contributing to ft_sanitizer
I would love your input! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## I Develop with Github
I use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## I Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (I use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). I actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU General Public License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GnuV3.0 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/hypn0x/ft_sanitizer/issues)
I use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/hypn0x/ft_sanitizer/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
